# Field surveys App

We developed an interactive web application to facilitate multi-taxon field sampling and data collection using the Shiny for Python platform. This app serves the following purposes:

1. It allows researchers, citizen scientists, students, and others to easily design and conduct standardized surveys for various organisms, such as arthropods, birds, and plants.
2. The app is accessible on any device with an internet connection, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

This user-friendly application streamlines the process of field sampling and data collection, making it more efficient and accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of their technical expertise or location.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fieldsurveys
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher (Install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- tkinter (will be included with your python installation)
- survey.yaml file (see instructions [below](#surveyyaml-file))
- Data CSV files (see instructions [below](#data-csv-files))
- keyfile.json (see instructions [below](#keyfilejson))

Please ensure that you have all the prerequisites before proceeding with running the app.

## survey.yaml file

This is the config file that allows the user to configure the app to their specific needs. The *survey.yaml* file should be created using the **Survey App config generator** over [here](https://nafcillincat.shinyapps.io/survey_config_generator/). The **Survey App config generator** allows the user to create a survey.yaml file by providing the following information in a step-by-step process:

1. Surveyor names
2. Survey locations
3. Survey plots
4. Survey points
5. Survey sides
6. Survey data sources
7. Company logo url
8. Database link
9. Google Workbook Name
10. Google Drive Folder Id

## Data CSV files

If you do not know what a CSV file is or how to create one, read this [article](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001356.htm) to get you started.
The app requires users to upload data CSV files. These CSV files should contain the data that the user wants to collect during the survey. The CSV files must have the following headers (first line) in the specified order:

1. Common Name
2. Genus
3. Species

The app also supports an additional column called ***Alpha Code***, but it is not mandatory.

An example is shown below:

```csv
Alpha Code,Common Name,Genus,Species
PLOC,American sycamore,Platanus,occidentalis
SALA,Arroyo willow,Salix,lasiolepis
PEAM,Avocado,Persea,americana
ARGL,Big berry manzanita,Arctostaphylos,glauca
ACMA,Bigleaf maple,Acer,macrophyllum
```

Ensure your CSV file follows the required format before uploading. You can use multiple CSV files, one for each survey type (e.g., plants, trees, grasses).

## keyfile.json

To download the keyfile.json for your Google Cloud account as a first-time user, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. If you don't have a Google Cloud project, create a new one by clicking on the "Select a project" dropdown at the top of the console and then clicking "New Project".
1. Once you have a project, navigate to the "APIs & Services" section from the sidebar menu or search for it in the top search bar.
1. Click on "Credentials" in the left-hand menu.
1. Click on "Create Credentials" and then select "Service Account" from the dropdown menu.
1. In the "Service Account" screen, provide a name for your service account and a description (optional).
1. Under the "Grant this service account access to project" section, choose the appropriate role(s) for your service account. For example, if you want to access Google Drive, you can select the "Editor" role.
1. Click on "Create Key" to create a new key for your service account.
1. In the "Create Private Key" window, select the "JSON" key type.
1. Click "Create" to generate and download the keyfile.json file to your local machine.


**Note:** *Keep this **keyfile.json** file secure, as it contains sensitive information that can be used to access your Google Cloud resources. You'll need this file to authenticate and authorize your applications when making API calls to Google Cloud services.*


## Run the app on your machine

To instantiate the app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
fieldsurveys
```

Follow the instructions on the screen to select your survey.yaml, data CSV files, and keyfile.json. It will then ask you for the directory where you want to store the app. Once you have provided all the necessary information, the app will be created in the specified directory.

## Deploying the app on the web (so it can be accessed from anywhere)

To deploy the app on the web, you can use the Shinyapps.io platform. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.posit.co/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html#working-with-shiny-for-python) to deploy your app on the Shinyapps.io platform.
